How does an empty museum connect audiences with its exhibitions and/or collections? How does it remain a place of learning and inspiration while its doors are closed?

Museum responses to coronavirus-related closures have taken a number of forms. We've gathered a handful of these responses in hopes of providing a helpful resource for would-be audiences to enjoy from home. Nothing can replace the experience of visiting these institutions in person. But we're thankful for the resourceful ways in which they've brought art into our homes.
